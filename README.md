# Day 1 - Introduction to Docker & Kubernetes

## Core Concept Questions

### Why is Docker useful in building and deploying microservices?

Docker enables consistent environments across development, testing, and production. For microservices (like an e-commerce or banking app), it allows developers to isolate services, use different tech stacks, and deploy updates independently, reducing conflicts and improving scalability.

### What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?

A Docker **image** is a blueprint for creating containers. It contains the app and dependencies. A **container** is a running instance of an image. In a scalable app, multiple containers (instances) can be spawned from the same image.

### How does Kubernetes complement Docker at scale?

Docker handles single containers. Kubernetes orchestrates multiple containers across many machines â€” handling deployment, scaling, load balancing, health checks, and self-healing. It's crucial for running large-scale apps reliably.
